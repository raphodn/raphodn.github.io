## Langtang

In 2018 I took a week off and headed to Nepal to trek in the Langtang area. It's not the most famous destination for tourists (they usually head to Everest or Annapurna area), but it was the closest from Kathmandu and doable in a limited time (less than a week). You also avoid taking the plane, though the 10+ hour bus journey is not recommended for the faint-hearted.

I ended up creating the Wikivoyage page for the Langtang Valley Trek. You can read it [here](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Langtang_Valley_Trek)!

I've also mapped my trek's day-to-day: https://observablehq.com/@raphodn/langtang-valley-trek-nepal
