It took a while, but I finally allocated some time to revamp my personal website.

I'm switching from an old Angular 1 SPA (that I hadn't updated since moving to Singapore) hosted on Heroku, to a static-site generator (GatsbyJS) hosted on Github pages.

You can still view my previous website <a href="http://www.raphaelodini.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> while I migrate the content.

The nitty-gritty details of this new website are detailed [here](/colophon).
