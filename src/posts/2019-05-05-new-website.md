It took a while, but I finally allocated some time to revamp my personal website.

I'm switching from an old Angular 1 SPA (that I hadn't updated since I moved to Singapore) hosted on Heroku, to a static-site generator (GatsbyJS) hosted on Github pages.

You can still view my previous website [here](http://www.raphaelodini.com/) while I migrate the content.

The nitty-gritty details of this new website are detailed [here](/colophon).
