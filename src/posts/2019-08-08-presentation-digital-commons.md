Over the last 2 months, the size of the team at Refinitiv Labs has almost doubled. With the new joiners, we've decided to setup a bi-monthly _Passion Share_ session where anyone can introduce us to an activity or project they're passionate about.

Yesterday was my turn, and among the many subjects I considered presenting, I chose the digital commons. It would be a good challenge to gather my thoughts and examples in some slides, share the concept in simple terms (not an easy feat :sweat_smile:). I did struggle a bit to find good content online on the subject (I even felt there were much better content when searching for the French naming _communs num√©riques_).

There's 2 personal projects I worked on this year that relate to the subject of the digital commons:
- OpenStreetMap x Singapore
- OpenFoodFacts x Redmart

Anyway, the presentation went great!

The slides can be accessed here (done a bit quickly using Markdown): <a href="https://hackmd.io/@raphodn/BkyI9MDXS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hackmd.io/@raphodn/BkyI9MDXS</a> (for the raw Markdown file, click <a href="https://github.com/raphodn/digital-commons-presentation/blob/master/digital-commons-presentation.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)
