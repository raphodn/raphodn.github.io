Stuff to focus in priority on:
- new job (innovation in the public service), new status (freelance), new work-life balance (working 4 days a week), new directions (open data, commons, digital inclusion)
- get involved in associations and local communities I care about
- gardening
- DIY and low-tech projects
- sports and slow travel
- spend more time with friends & family
