[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) is a website that helps you track and share the books your read. It's a great platform, easily on my Top-10-websites list :sparkles:

Many of the books are - I believe - added automatically from Amazon (it was bought by Amazon in 2013), but users can also add missing books as well as edit current ones. You need to be a regular user and request for a librarian status.

You guessed it, over the past few years I've started spending more and more time improving the data of the website. Goodreads tells me I've done 789 edits in the last 12 months! From including small authors who's book I've stumbled on, to adding the ebook version of a more important work, or just combining multiple editions of a same book. One goal of having cleaner data, on top of helping the community, is to improve my [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) ebook library and making it sync successfully with my Goodreads account.

Anyways, after having added dozens of book, I considered ways to automate this process. Most of the books I add are ebooks, that are found on [kobo.com](https://www.kobo.com/). Wouldn't it be great to automatically extract the book details from Kobo and add them to Goodreads? Let's find out.

## Goodreads API

Goodreads' API (docs [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api)) is great and very thorough, covering most of the possible interactions a user can have with the website... except creating a book :sweat_smile:

So we'll have to find another way to upload the book data.
