The company uses innovative statistical & econometrical tools to provide operational recommendations and advices, driving the client's marketing and media performance. Employees (about 130) are mostly in Paris, but there's also offices in London, New-York, Hong-Kong & Dubai.<br>Fun fact: the Paris headquarters were selected as one of the '2015â€™s World's Coolest Offices' by <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/careers/gallery/2015/nov/13/the-worlds-coolest-offices-in-pictures' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>The Guardian</a> and <a href='http://www.inc.com/worlds-coolest-offices-2015.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>INC Magazine</a>!</p><p><b>My work: </b>I was part of the Product Engineering team - a small bunch of 7-8 full-stack developers, all self-taught passionate young people I really (really) enjoyed working with! We delivered tailor-made data-driven web applications (dashboards, monitoring & simulation tools, etc) that were collaborative, secure, easy to use, and available from anywhere, at any time. These tools were used to support strategic decision-making and improve data consistency in the clients' marketing teams.<br>To describe my day-to-day job in a few words, I would say it was about 70% Full-Stack Developer, 10% Consultant, 10% Data Science, and 10% Other.</p><p><b>Tech stack: </b></p>"
